<h2>A selection made by Owen</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spider-man - Into the Spider-verse</h3>
<p>
    The stripbook-style graphics are aesthetically pleasing, <br> 
    the music is on point and the humor is simple and dry.
</p>
<h3>The Talented Mr. Ripley</h3>
<p>
    The aesthetics of a young Matt Damon and Jude Law <br>
    in Italy with some psychological eariness to it.
</p>
<h3>The Big Short</h3>
<p>
    Based on true events, funny and educational. The way <br>
    different storylines were displayed was pretty interessting.
